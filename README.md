# Git Repository for Zak Burke's Undergraduate Engineering Thesis

The old_smart_smart code is the initial smart watch application developed on the Samsung Gear S3 classic utilising Samsung's Tizen SDK

The final_smart_watch file contains the code for the smart watch used for this thesis project on the Samsung Galaxy Watch5 utilising Wear OS
* the initial structure of the smart watch code which allowed for composable elements in the mainactivity.kt was partially adapted from https://developer.android.com/codelabs/compose-for-wear-os#0

The embedded devices were programmed using Zephyr RTOS on ESP32 development boards. A linux VM was used and CP210x drivers were required for programming and interfacing.
